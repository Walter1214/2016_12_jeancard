In the design, we re-present the “film” concept of films on masking tape with light and shadows and the time line.<br/>A total of 70 foreign guests from 20 countries, such as the USA, France, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Japan, South Korea, China, the UK, and Germany, attended TIDF. A total of 100 to 140 documentaries in about 250 sessions attracted about 30,000 audience-times. Audiences were given masking tape on condition.'],[2,'Cloud Gate Theater','Souvenir for the grand opening of the Cloud Gate Theater in 2015','Two styles of masking tape were designed as the souvenir for the grand opening of the Cloud Gate Theater. Both feature the calligraphic work of “雲門” (Cloud Gate) by artist Grace Y. T. Tong. One is in maccha green and silver, and the other one is in emerald and black. Both carry the token consisting of the theater’s contour surrounded by mountains. The specially designed token has clean and beautiful contours; light, thin and transparent paper to present the theater’s characteristics.<br/>With the “Meeting Guests at the Gate” invitation card or the performance ticket, or by checking in on the fan clubs, one can get one roll of souvenir masking tape. '],[3,'ARUKAS Original Group','Special color masking tapes','This is a project commissioned by an individual in 2016. The image of ARUKAS is elegant and elaborate. The butterfly, feather, sculptured pattern, and butterfly token are presented with a gold identity color. With special masking tape production technology, we present the lightweight, transparent and elaborate characteristics. Together with the soy ink delivery of perfect color development, we marked out the lightweight and lustrous sense with embossed gold and pale pastel colors. The core and tape were neatly cut to present a safe to use feeling.'],[4,'Otsuka Pharmaceutical','Otsuka Sticky Note','The sticky note was ordered by Otsuka Pharmaceutical as a gift to promote its Pletaal tablet in 2015. Characters including “cardiovascular drug” and “stroke ahead” were punched on the sticky note to present the medication’s function and scenario and combine with the appeal and function of the medication in the interesting advertisement.<br/>With i-Maker’s exclusive sticky note punching technology, we enhance the overall value of sticky notes. When seeing the fun slogan (Stroke Ahead), people will smile and relieve their stress in busy work. This may probably reduce the chance of a real stroke.<br/>']]
